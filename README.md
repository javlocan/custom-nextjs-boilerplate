# NEXTJS POD ARCHI - BOILERPLATE

Has Typescript, ESLINT, src/+AppRouter for PODs architecture. Scenes folder is replaced by app folder.
Starts with an example Auth Context and an example POD (stuff-list) to help remember the structure.

** POD architecture is a little slow, but it is methodical (less errors) and mantainable.
